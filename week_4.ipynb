    "Boston, Massachusetts is one of the most widely known cities in the United States. The city proper covers 127 km2 and, as of 2018, the estimated population is 694,583 (see: [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/bostoncitymassachusetts/PST045218 \"US Census Bureau\")). The fact thet it's not very big actually gives an additional value to it: a tourist can explore city's many sides in a relatively short amount of time and it could potentially be a very livable place. The rich tradition and history, the many different cultures coexisting in the same place, some of the most prominent educational centers in the city and the vicinity, the fact that it is a home of the Celtics - the most successful (with regard to the number of championship titles) basketball franchise in NBA - the Red Sox, the Patriots and the Bruins, the popularity of St.Patrick's tradition and so many more things, make it one of the most attractive place in the world for settling in and for business too. The very high [*Quality of Life Index*](https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/Boston)  and low [*Pollution Index*](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/in/Boston) highly contibute to its desirability.

    "Our client is highly interested in starting a business in Boston. The plan is to open a family restaurant. But, it's a very responsible decision to make and it can't be left to the case. Serious investment requires a well informed, data based decision. However, officially, the city of Boston consists of 23 varied neighborhoods. How to choose between them? Which ones have a lot to offer and which ones are low on the ladder? Which ones should be taken into consideration and which ones leave out of consideration? This is the problem that we are going to tackle here: exclude the neighborhoods that are not the best options and end up with a few neighborhoods that represent the most suitable places for starting a family business like the one mentioned."
